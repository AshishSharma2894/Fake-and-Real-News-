# Fake-and-Real-News-Using-Python

Fake news refers to misinformation, disinformation or mal-information which is spread through word of mouth and traditional media and more recently through digital forms of communication such as edited videos, memes, unverified advertisements and social media propagated rumours.Fake news spread through social media has become a serious problem, with the potential of it resulting in mob violence, suicides etc as a result of misinformation circulated on social media.

This dataset consists of about 50000 articles consisting of fake as well as real news. Our aim is train our model so that it can correctly predict whether a given piece of news is real or fake.The fake and real news data is given in two separate datasets with each dataset consisting around 22000 articles each.

Introduction to GloVe
GloVe method is built on an important idea, You can derive semantic relationships between words from the co-occurrence matrix. Given a corpus having V words, the co-occurrence matrix X will be a V x V matrix, where the i th row and j th column of X, X_ij denotes how many times word i has co-occurred with word j. 

The co-occurrence matrix for the sentence “the cat sat on the mat” with a window size of 1. As you probably noticed it is a symmetric matrix. How do we get a metric that measures semantic similarity between words from this? For that, you will need three words at a time.
